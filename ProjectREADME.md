# Battle of the Bands

Battle of the Bands is a text-based 1-player game where a user is tasked with creating a band, picking its name and customizing its attributes, then pitting that band against a computer opponent's band
in battle. Both bands perform for a panel of 3 judges. Their scores are added up, and the response of the audience is taken into account, to provide a final grade. The band that receives the highest grade is announced the winner of the battle of the bands.
